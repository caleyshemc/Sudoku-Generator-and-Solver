This project, written in MIPS assembly, generates and solves solvable Sudoku puzzles.
The solver will solve a valid sudoku puzzle as generated by the generator or as entered by the user.  The generator creates a valid Sudoku puzzle.  There is a difficulty selector in the generator that sets the difficulty of the puzzle by removing an higher number of numbers with higher difficulty.
